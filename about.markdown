Her aim is to teach solo, small and large businesses how to use data to deliver business goals, provide value to customers, build trust and loyalty, boost productivity, and generate more revenue.

# About Edafe Onerhime
Edafe Onerhime is a Data Specialist, consultant, speaker, and writer. **She is an expert in leading collaborative change around the value and use of data**.

Edafe has 25 years experience in public sector consultancy, charities, social investment, consumer finance, and retail. She consults with public bodies like the [Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office), funders like [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/), and businesses like [Social Investment Business](https://www.sibgroup.org.uk/) and [FutureGov](https://www.wearefuturegov.com/).

Her motto is: **Data + Design + Culture**

# Latest Writing
**Edafe wrote** the Open Standards for Data Guidebook, a synthesis of best practices for open data initiatives gathered from a variety of people and organisations. Edafe designed the guidebook **for people with little data management experience** as well as data-savvy professionals. Using her guidebook, clean-tech startup Dsposal won a bid for DEFRA’s [KnoWaste waste disposal tracking project](https://dsposal.uk/articles/knowaste-govtech-catalyst/).

# Recent Products
Edafe’s team created a **widely-accepted** open standard for the DEFRA-funded [KnoWaste project](https://dsposal.uk/articles/knowaste-govtech-catalyst/). KnoWaste improves waste tracking, increases recycling rates, and reduces waste crime that costs the UK over £600 million per year. Edafe ensured that the prototype included feedback from a wide range of users across the waste management sector, leading to **broader acceptance of the standard**. Despite the need to expand the scope of the original study, **Edafe’s team was the only one to deliver a working prototype within the 12-week schedule**.

# Best Practices
**Edafe developed sound data quality practices** for Open Data Services and led successful education and advocacy efforts for their adoption. The widespread adoption of these standards led to a significant increase in data quality and usability, **which in turn increased the number of 360Giving publishing partners from 10 to 70 in 18 months**. Partnerships are still growing, and everyday use of data has improved.

# Interests
Edafe continues to advise the UK government on adoption of open standards as a member of the Open Standards Board, and she enriches our society as an RSA fellow.

She is a passionate and active supporter of diversity and inclusion in technology spaces. She currently lives in England with her wife and far too many books to read in one lifetime.
