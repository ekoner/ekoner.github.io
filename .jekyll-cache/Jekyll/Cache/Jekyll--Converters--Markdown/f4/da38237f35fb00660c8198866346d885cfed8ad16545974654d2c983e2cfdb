<h1 id="about-edafe-onerhime">About Edafe Onerhime</h1>
<p>Edafe Onerhime is a Data Specialist, consultant, speaker, and writer. <strong>She is an expert in leading collaborative change around the value and use of data</strong>.</p>

<p>Edafe has 25 years experience in public sector consultancy, charities, social investment, consumer finance, and retail. She consults with public bodies like the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office">Cabinet Office</a>, funders like <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>, and businesses like <a href="https://www.sibgroup.org.uk/">Social Investment Business</a> and <a href="https://www.wearefuturegov.com/">FutureGov</a>.</p>

<p>Her motto is: <strong>Data + Design + Culture</strong></p>

<h1 id="latest-writing">Latest Writing</h1>
<p><strong>Edafe wrote</strong> the Open Standards for Data Guidebook, a synthesis of best practices for open data initiatives gathered from a variety of people and organisations. Edafe designed the guidebook <strong>for people with little data management experience</strong> as well as data-savvy professionals. Using her guidebook, clean-tech startup Dsposal won a bid for DEFRAâ€™s <a href="https://dsposal.uk/articles/knowaste-govtech-catalyst/">KnoWaste waste disposal tracking project</a>.</p>

<h1 id="recent-products">Recent Products</h1>
<p>Edafeâ€™s team created a <strong>widely-accepted</strong> open standard for the DEFRA-funded <a href="https://dsposal.uk/articles/knowaste-govtech-catalyst/">KnoWaste project</a>. KnoWaste improves waste tracking, increases recycling rates, and reduces waste crime that costs the UK over Â£600 million per year. Edafe ensured that the prototype included feedback from a wide range of users across the waste management sector, leading to <strong>broader acceptance of the standard</strong>. Despite the need to expand the scope of the original study, <strong>Edafeâ€™s team was the only one to deliver a working prototype within the 12-week schedule</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h1>
<p><strong>Edafe developed sound data quality practices</strong> for Open Data Services and led successful education and advocacy efforts for their adoption. The widespread adoption of these standards led to a significant increase in data quality and usability, <strong>which in turn increased the number of 360Giving publishing partners from 10 to 70 in 18 months</strong>. Partnerships are still growing, and everyday use of data has improved.</p>

<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
<p>Edafe continues to advise the UK government on adoption of open standards as a member of the Open Standards Board, and she enriches our society as an RSA fellow.</p>

<p>She is a passionate and active supporter of diversity and inclusion in technology spaces. She currently lives in England with her wife and far too many books to read in one lifetime.</p>
