[![Quote: A data strategy belongs in the board room](/assets/images/headers/header-diverse-boardroom-min.jpg)](/assets/images/headers/header-diverse-boardroom-min.jpg)

Businesses have always run on data, from [5,000 year old Sumerian trade on clay tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer#Language_and_writing) to today’s silicon-driven [artificial intelligence algorithms](https://eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/Artificial_intelligence_in_the_real_world_1.pdf), data is at the heart of practically every business decision.

Data is used everywhere in your business and in every team.  Successful businesses use data to:

* Deliver marketing strategy by creating market segments
* Help sales predict which customers will buy what products and when
* Monitor customer satisfaction in customer services

Better data leads to better decisions which creates competitive advantage. Here I’ll explain why you need a data strategy and how to get started.

Just as [a good business strategy is a roadmap](https://hbr.org/2007/09/demystifying-strategy-the-what) to creating competitive advantage, a data strategy is roadmap to how your business will get, store, use and protect data to meet its goals.

An effective [data strategy](https://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy) is both defensive (protect, update and keep data accurate) and offensive (use data to compete, be productive and make a profit).

In some businesses, data strategy is part of the IT plan. This is business risk. Positioning data as part of technology misses the value of [data as a strategic asset](https://blogs.informatica.com/2015/11/23/data-strategic-asset/#fbid=4WO3pGQ8V0S).  Data brings both risks (and the need for a defensive data strategy) and benefits (which needs an offensive data strategy).

[![Quote: Data is a strategic asset](/assets/images/quotes/quote-data-is-a-strategic-asset-min.png)](/assets/img/quotes/quote-data-is-a-strategic-asset-min.png)

Without an effective defensive data strategy, your business risks:

* **Fines for noncompliance**: If your business collects, uses or manages information about people, it may also need to comply with regulations like the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/) (**GDPR**)  or the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) (**HIPAA**). GDPR fines are intentionally painful for businesses, large and small. Fines are up to €10 million, or up to 2% of the worldwide revenue for the previous financial year.
* **Poor decision-making**: Flawed or incomplete data can lead to employees making decisions that hurt a business, like accounting errors because customer data is duplicated, or over-spending because stock levels are wrong.
* **Hidden costs**: [Poor data leads to expensive mistakes](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-data-costs-the-u-s-3-trillion-per-year) which cause partners, suppliers and customers to lose trust in a business. Employees that have to workaround poor data are less productive, customers are impacted when orders are sent to the wrong address and suppliers become irate when invoices are paid late.
* **Negative media coverage**: There’s also a risk of unwanted media attention when serious mistakes are made, like sending correspondence to a deceased person, or mistakes in the companies financial reports.

With an effective offensive data strategy, your business can compete with:

* **A central view of information**: It’s likely your business uses a mix of products to manage accounting and customers, customer communication channels like social media and mailing lists. Each of these products stores information about customers, suppliers, sales, and more. With a good data strategy, you can have a central view of customers, suppliers and other important information. This central view becomes your business’s single source of truth.
* **Business-wide buy-in**: Making a data strategy a purely IT effort can lead to a lack of buy-in from other areas of your business. In IT, data becomes a technology problem. In the boardroom, data becomes everyone’s  responsibility.
* **Business strategy support**:  Your data strategy supports your business strategy with data (facts, statistics, numbers)  to test your vision, understand your networks, refine your mission and deliver your goals.

**A data strategy is a business-wide plan for competing, with data**.  A data strategy belongs in the board room.

To get started with a data strategy:

* Treat data as an asset aligned with your business strategy
* Bring ownership of business data to the boardroom
* Balance defensive and offensive data strategy

**In my next article**, I share why data strategy fails and how you can get it right.
